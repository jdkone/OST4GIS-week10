# Final Project Proposal

I would like to continue working with the data I used for the midterm, but include more data, context, and features.

## Problem / Question

My application will focus on how Colorado's cannabis legalization has affected various planning-related issues, such as crime, gentrification, and/or economic development, in Denver. The application's purpose is to inform, and will have an interactive map and drop-down menu of map layers that include:
- Locations of dispensaries/retailers (point)
- Number of new commercial building permits (either point or aggregated to polygon)
- Crime (density/heat map)
- Aggregated home values, demographics, etc (polygon)
The application will also

## The data

My data comes from Denver's open data site and the census. For census data, I will use the Census API. For the other data, I use an ajax call to pull the data from the site. The point data needs to be converted into geojson.

## Technologies used

I plan to use jQuery and underscore, as well as Carto.

## Design spec

#### User experience

I think the users will be those interested in policy, whether they work in the field, or are simply interested in the topic. Other states preparing for legalization might also be interested. The Urban Displacement Project's website is a somewhat similar concept.

#### Layouts and visual design

I think I am planning to use a transparent side bar and a top bar in addition to the map. However, I would be open to other ways of laying things out.

## Anticipated difficulties

I have generally struggled the most with the functional aspects. Simpler functions that interact with HTML are easier for me, but the more complex ones tend to be difficult.

## Missing pieces

I would be interested in learning more about React.
